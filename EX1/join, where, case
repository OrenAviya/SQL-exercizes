## 1. Explain in words. What is the purpose of the following query?

select OrderID, OrderDate, coalesce(ShippedDate, 'not yet') as ShippedDate, 
DATEDIFF(coalesce(ShippedDate, curdate()), OrderDate) as HowLong
from orders
order by DATEDIFF(coalesce(ShippedDate, curdate()), OrderDate) Desc

**answer:**
This query gets its information from the “orders” table, it displays the following columns:
OrderID
OrderDate
ShippedDate - which would either contain the date of the shipment and if it is NULL (missing) it’ll be replaced with ‘not yet’
HowLong -will either be the amount of days the shipment took and if it hasn’t been shipped yet it’ll display the #days since the order was made.
Overall the table will be ordered according to the HowLong column in a decreasing order meaning the the largest amount of time will be displayed first.


## 2. Write a query that returns for each product that is almost out of stock (there are less than 10 units in stock and on order)
together (the product number, the product name, the supplier's name, the supplier's phone number and how many additional units are needed
Order to reach a total of 100 units in stock. You must also display products whose supplier information is missing:

**answer:**
SELECT products.ProductID, products.ProductName,coalesce(products.SupplierID, "empty")
,coalesce(suppliers.CompanyName, "empty") , coalesce(suppliers.Phone , "empty"), (100- products.UnitsInStock) as
`to order`
FROM products JOIN suppliers ON products.SupplierID= suppliers.SupplierID
 WHERE (products.UnitsInStock+products.UnitsOnOrder)<10
 ORDER BY products.SupplierID
